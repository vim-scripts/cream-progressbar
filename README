A function that, when called, draws a progress bar in the command line:

    Loading file... [####################             ] 65%

Displays and allows options to:
  1. Display the progress through RPM-like characters
  2. Display an initial description string
  3. Allows selection of the character used for the bar
  4. Optionally, allows any bar length (default is window width)

Just use a call such as:
  call ProgressBar( 65, "Loading file...", "#", 0 )


This is one of many custom utilities and functions for gVim from the Cream project (http://cream.sourceforge.net), a configuration of Vim for those of us familiar with Apple and Windows software.
